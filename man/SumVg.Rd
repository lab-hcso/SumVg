\title{
Sum of variance explained by all SNPs in GWAS (for a continuous trait), with standard error estimate
}
\description{
This function estimates the sum of variance explained (i.e. heritbaility) by all SNPs in GWAS of a continuous trait,
with standard error estimate
}
\usage{
SumVg(zall, totalN, method = "paraboot", d = 1, repl = 50,
out = "unconditional")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{zall}{
A vector of z-statistics from a GWAS (or meta-analyses of GWAS); the z-statistics are assumed to be LD-pruned
}
  \item{totalN}{
Total sample size
}
  \item{method}{
Describes the method for standard error estimation. Options include:
\cr "jack"(jackknife);
\cr "paraboot"(parametric bootstrap using the corrected z value as mean for simulation);
\cr "fdrboot1"(parametric bootstrap using the observed z value as mean with consideration of local fdr) ;
\cr "fdrboot2"(parametric bootstrap using the corrected z value as mean with consideration of local fdr)
}
  \item{d}{
The number of observations to be left out in each jackknife replicate
}
  \item{repl}{
Number of replications for resampling
}
  \item{out}{
Describes the type of sum of Vg. Options include "conditional" (conditional on H1) and "unconditional".
}
}
\details{
This function estimates the sum of variance explained (i.e. heritbaility) by all SNPs in GWAS of a continuous trait.
The standard error is estimated using various resampling approaches.
