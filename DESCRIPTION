        association studies (GWAS) based on summary statistics with
        standard error estimates
Version: 1.0
Author: Hon-Cheong SO

Description: This package estimates SNP-based heritability in GWAS based on summary statistics, and provides standard error (SE) estimates of the heritability.
    The method is based on an empirical Bayes approach, and does not require any distributional assumptions of the SNP effects.
